# SmartContract_Frontend

I created a user interface in a browser, I use drizzle - https://www.trufflesuite.com/drizzle. 
I have uploaded smart contracts to the project from my other repository SmartContract_BuyCars. In this user interface, we can create a list of cars and a list of users, create purchase orders for a car and undergo maintenance by writing off tokens for this.
